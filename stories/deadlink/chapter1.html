                        <p>In the year 2029, a mobile game named Deadlink appeared on every smartphone across the globe. No one downloaded it. No one remembered installing it. Yet, when it opened, it opened for everyone.</p>
                        <p>“Welcome, Player. HP synced. Ability assigned. Let the purge begin.”</p>
                        <p>Each person was assigned a unique power, tethered to their psyche, desires, or hidden fears. Alongside it appeared an HP bar on their phone screen—real-time, constant, inescapable.</p>
                        <p>What players learned too late was this:</p>
                        <p>When your HP hits zero in the game, your real body dies. Permanently.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Gerbert Maddox, 30, a quiet engineering student obsessed with systems and mechanics, was among the first to truly use the game.</p>
                        <p>Deadlink gave him the ability: Manifest — the power to summon anything he understood fully. Firearms, siege engines, surveillance tech. If he knew how it worked, he could create it.</p>
                        <p>In his first moment of combat, Gerbert conjured a medieval trebuchet on a crumbling city overpass. A firebomb soared across the skyline, eliminating five players. The horror of it left him shaken.</p>
                        <p>But the game demanded blood, not hesitation.</p>
                        <p>Movement, conjuring, even hiding cost HP. Rest was rare. Combat was constant.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Rann, 29, a goth girl hardened by a broken home, found solace in solitude. Her ability: Phase — the power to slip into and through solid matter. Walls, floors, even steel.</p>
                        <p>But phasing didn’t cost HP—it cost stamina. Each phase built exhaustion. And if she pushed too far, she risked glitching into the void between spaces.</p>
                        <p>Her strategy was stealth and precision. She became a whisper in the battlefield, a ghostly assassin.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Ace, also 29, was flamboyant and unpredictable. Every step he took bloomed flowers. His gift: Verdant Dominion — the power to manipulate plant life. He turned nature into a weapon.</p>
                        <p>Thorny vines impaled enemies. Razor-sharp petals danced like blades. Blossoms exploded in clouds of psychedelic pollen. Where Ace walked, the battlefield became a garden of chaos and death.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The world fractured. Cities crumbled into arenas. Forests twisted into labyrinths. Beaches became death traps. Survivors became killers. Killers became legends.</p>
                        <p>In the ruins of a mall during the game’s midpoint, Gerbert, Rann, and Ace collided.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert conjured a drone turret, raining bullets across a shattered food court.</p>
                        <p>Rann phased through a broken escalator, slipping behind him.</p>
                        <p>Ace erupted the ground in roots and sunflower mines that sprayed venom clouds.</p>
                        <p>They clashed—deadly, focused, bloodied.</p>
                        <p>But in the heart of the chaos, none of them wanted to win. Not like this.</p>
                        <p>Temporary alliances sparked in the fire. Could they find a way to break the game’s cycle? Or were they doomed to kill until only one heartbeat remained?</p>
                        <p>Because Deadlink didn’t just watch.</p>
                        <p>It adapted. It judged. It fed.</p>
                        <p>And it was always watching.</p>

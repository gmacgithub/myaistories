                        <p>Gerbert’s early weeks in Deadlink were a blur of blood, silence, and sleepless calculations.</p>
                        <p>He learned the hard way: every action cost HP. Conjuring even basic weaponry chipped away at his life. A crossbow? Light drain. A turret? Dangerous. A railgun? Nearly suicidal.</p>
                        <p>But the worst part wasn’t the toll on his body. It was the faces. The dying players. Their final looks.</p>
                        <p>He started wearing gloves—not for utility, but to stop feeling the cold steel of his own conjurations.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Game 9 dropped him into the blown-out ruins of an electrical grid facility, where steel catwalks twisted like bones and wires hung like webbing. The kill count was already in double digits.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert crouched beneath a wrecked transformer. HP: 48/100.</p>
                        <p>He had a short-range railgun conjured—devastating, but heavy. His breath came in sharp bursts.</p>
                        <p>Then the wires moved.</p>
                        <p>They slithered.</p>
                        <p>A figure dropped from above in a cracked electrical suit, his nametag blinking:</p>
                        <p>Zappo – HP: 81/100</p>
                        <p>“You’re the conjurer, right?” Zappo sneered. “The Builder. The Guy Who Doesn’t Kill Unless He Has To.”</p>
                        <p>Wires hissed to life, fanged and writhing like serpents.</p>
                        <p>One struck.</p>
                        <p>[HP -12] → 36/100</p>
                        <p>Gerbert rolled aside, bleeding.</p>
                        <p>Another player appeared—clean-cut, charming, surrounded by five perfect clones.</p>
                        <p>Replikid – HP: 60/100</p>
                        <p>“I don’t usually team up,” Replikid said with a grin. “But watching Zappo toy with you? Couldn’t resist.”</p>
                        <p>Gerbert was surrounded. He couldn’t conjure anything fast enough. Not without burning his HP to zero.</p>
                        <p>Then—</p>
                        <p>A hand grabbed him from the floor below.</p>
                        <p>The world shimmered—and he phased through the steel.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>He landed hard. Darkness, then light.</p>
                        <p>Standing over him: black ponytail, smudged eyeliner, combat boots.</p>
                        <p>Rann. Her breath was ragged. She looked half-dead, but unbroken.</p>
                        <p>“Get up, Engineer Boy.”</p>
                        <p>Wires phased through the floor above, hissing. Rann grabbed a pipe, melted into a wall, and exploded outward—impaling one of Replikid’s clones.</p>
                        <p>“Three seconds. Conjure something.”</p>
                        <p>Gerbert’s mind kicked into overdrive:</p>
                        <p>Threat Type: Multi-angle. Solution: Auto-turret. 360° tracking. Facial lockout.</p>
                        <p>Turret deployed.</p>
                        <p>Bullets flew.</p>
                        <p>Clones dropped.</p>
                        <p>Zappo screamed—Rann struck again, kicking him into the turret's line of fire.</p>
                        <p>[Zappo – HP: 0/100]</p>
                        <p>[Replikid – HP: 0/100]</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Silence.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert collapsed, HP now 17. Rann knelt beside him, just as winded.</p>
                        <p>“Why... help me?” he asked.</p>
                        <p>She didn’t meet his eyes. “You build things. Useful things. Maybe you’ll figure out how to kill this f***ing game.”</p>
                        <p>She leaned against the wall, head tilted back.</p>
                        <p>“Until then… I’m not letting good pieces go to waste.”</p>
                        <p>Not a friendship.</p>

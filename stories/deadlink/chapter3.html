                    <div>
                        <p>No buildings. No shadows. No shelter. Just wind-cut grass, broken stone monuments, and open sky.</p>
                        <p>It was a battlefield designed to strip away cleverness and reveal only power. There was nowhere to hide.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert and Rann had made it halfway across the plateau in practiced silence. Her steps were light, measured. His eyes scanned the horizon, fingers twitching near his conjureplate.</p>
                        <p>That’s when the air changed</p>
                        <p>A breeze swept past, thick with something out of place. Not smoke. Not dust.</p>
                        <p>Floral.</p>
                        <p>Rann’s body tensed. “It’s him.”</p>
                        <p>A patch of grass ahead exploded.</p>
                        <p>Petals, vines, roots—bursting in every direction in a riot of color and motion. Flowers bloomed midair and spun to the ground like falling blades. From the heart of it all stepped a man dressed like spring itself.</p>
                        <p>Ace – HP: 93/100</p>
                        <p>Long pink coat flaring dramatically in the wind. Stylish boots that made flowers bloom beneath each step. His smile dazzled. His voice, when it came, rang with theatrical glee.</p>
                        <p>“Hello, darlings,” he said, cocking his head. “Lovely day to try and kill me, isn’t it?”</p>
                        <p>Rann’s reaction was instant—she phased backward behind a ruined stone block. Gerbert’s hand flew up, a barrier conjured just in time to deflect a sharp burst of rose-thorns that speared the earth between them.</p>
                        <p>“You again,” Gerbert muttered. “Of course.”</p>
                        <p>Ace stepped forward slowly, arms raised like a performer hitting his mark. “You wound me, engineer. After all the chemistry we’ve shared?”</p>
                        <p>A turret snapped into place beside Gerbert, clanking and humming as it locked onto Ace.</p>
                        <p>“Let’s see if the garden can catch this,” Gerbert said flatly.</p>
                        <p><i>Click-click-click—FWHIP!</i></p>
                        <p>The turret fired. Three precision shots sliced through the air.</p>
                        <p>Ace spun. Vines rose in arcs to intercept. Each bullet deflected, thudding into the dirt.</p>
                        <p>Rann reappeared to the side, boots kicking up petals. She dashed low, phasing between broken pillars for cover, angling for Ace’s blind spot.</p>
                        <p>Ace caught her movement with the edge of his eye. “Still darting around like a shadow. You never slow down, do you, Rann?”</p>
                        <p>He twirled.</p>
                        <p>A ring of lilies burst outward from his heels, releasing a pollen wave.</p>
                        <p>Rann choked mid-phase, coughing hard as she emerged behind a stone. “He’s upgraded his field control.”</p>
                        <p>“Confirmed,” Gerbert said. “He’s playing the whole map.”</p>
                        <p>Ace walked with exaggerated grace, placing a hand on the ground. Vines surged upward, curving into a towering wall of bloom and thorn that separated Rann from Gerbert.</p>
                        <p>“Isolation tactic,” Rann warned. “He’s trying to split us.”</p>
                        <p>“Noted,” Gerbert replied. His hands glowed, assembling a compact sonic burst device on his wrist. “Let’s test his harmony.”</p>
                        <p>He slammed his palm to the ground. <i>SHOOM.</i> A focused sonic pulse radiated out.</p>
                        <p>Ace winced.</p>
                        <p>The flowers screamed in reply, twisting their petals into warped funnels to absorb and bend the sound.</p>
                        <p>The air turned discordant, strange.</p>
                        <p>Ace steadied himself, brushing pollen from his shoulder. “Okay, that one stung a bit.”</p>
                        <p>Rann burst through the vine wall, blade in hand. She swung wide, aiming for his midsection.</p>
                        <p>Ace ducked, back arched. A sunflower bloomed upward to intercept the strike, its thick stem acting like a shield. He kicked backward, forcing Rann to phase-step away before he could counter.</p>
                        <p>“Still sharp,” he said, panting now. “But not sharp enough.”</p>
                        <p>Gerbert fired a bolt of kinetic force, catching Ace in the side. The plant-wielder grunted, knocked off balance.</p>
                        <p>He crouched, breathing hard.</p>
                        <p>Petals drifted across the field. A silence settled.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert was sweating. His conjuration systems hummed with strain.</p>
                        <p>Rann had scratches along her arms. Pollen clung to her boots and gloves like glittering dust.</p>
                        <p>Ace stood slowly. A single flower rested between his fingers.</p>
                        <p>“Are we going to keep this up, sweethearts?” he said, softer now. “It’s getting a bit exhausting, and I do prefer to make an exit looking fabulous.”</p>
                        <p>Rann didn’t lower her guard. “We’re not here to die. But we will if we have to.”</p>
                        <p>Gerbert shook his head. “It doesn’t have to go that far.”</p>
                        <p>Ace’s smile wavered. “You two… you always talk like you're better than this place.”</p>
                        <p>“No,” Gerbert said, “we talk like people who want to survive without becoming monsters.”</p>
                        <p>Rann stepped closer. “Not every meeting has to end in a bloodbath.”</p>
                        <p>Ace looked between them, a flicker of something behind his eyes—fatigue, perhaps, or memory.</p>
                        <p>Then he let the flower fall.</p>
                        <p>It landed soundlessly in the grass.</p>
                        <p>“Fine,” he said. “But only because you’re both so stubbornly reasonable.”</p>
                        <p>He walked toward them—no vines followed.</p>
                        <p>Just steps.</p>
                        <p>Just a hand, outstretched.</p>
                        <p>“Ace,” he said, smiling like a man who’d just finished his performance. “Flamboyant, fabulous, and your new favorite mistake.”</p>
                        <p>“Gerbert,” the conjurer said, shaking it.</p>
                        <p>“Rann,” came her cool reply.</p>
                        <p>They stood in silence.</p>
                        <p>Not as allies.</p>
                        <p>Not yet.</p>
                        <p>But something softer than enemies.</p>
                        <p>The Plateau of Silence held its breath as the three turned away from battle.</p>
                        <p>Petals swirled in the wind behind them.</p>
                        <p>And peace, for once, bloomed.</p>

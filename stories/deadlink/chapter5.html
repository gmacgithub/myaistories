                    <div>
                        <p>After Game 10, Deadlink changed.</p>
                        <p>Not in the sudden chaos of a bloodier map or a deadlier monster.</p>
                        <p>But in what it revealed.</p>
                        <p>Because Deadlink wasn’t just a match-based bloodsport anymore. It wasn’t chaos for chaos’ sake. It was structure—a towering, brutal system built for control.</p>
                        <p>One hundred floors. A vertical world.</p>
                        <p>Each level a gauntlet, a world of its own—crafted to test, isolate, and reduce. But patterns had started to emerge, and for those who survived the early hell, the truth became visible.</p>
                        <p>Every five floors came a Safe Zone—places encased in invisible barriers. Temporary refuge. You could eat. Heal. Trade. But even those havens carried weight. You couldn’t stay forever. And everyone knew: safety was always rented, never owned.</p>
                        <p>At every thirtieth floor, everything shifted.</p>
                        <p>Floors 30, 60, and 90 weren’t just new challenges. They were filters. Purpose-built Dungeon Blocks sat there—zones designed to break the strongest, to weed out the rest. The survivors called them execution chambers with puzzles.</p>
                        <p>And they weren’t wrong.</p>
                        <p>Players whispered of it constantly now. If you wanted to live, you needed Blings. The currency that bought everything: weapons, food, beds, breathing room. It wasn’t just economy. It was oxygen.</p>
                        <p>Some players PK’d for them. Quietly. Strategically. You never knew who would vanish in the next floor drop.</p>
                        <p>No one knew who ran it.</p>
                        <p>No one had seen an Admin.</p>
                        <p>And death was permanent.</p>
                        <p>They gathered in a side room off the Safe Zone on Floor 11. Four of them. The war-room atmosphere was unofficial—but real.</p>
                        <p>A conjured map hovered above a projection plate in the center, flickering with neon-blue light. Floor scans. Resource data. Death percentages. A whole tower of numbers and blood.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert stood near the projection, focused on its grid lines. His eyes twitched behind his glasses, flicking between paths, probability notes, and density curves.</p>
                        <p>“Each floor has its own algorithm,” he said. “The Safe Zones are self-contained, but they’re temporary. Everything else keeps shifting. Traps, enemy types, terrain.”</p>
                        <p>Taan crouched nearby, arms resting on her knees. “We’re not meant to climb,” she said. “We’re meant to die before we see what’s above.”</p>
                        <p>She pointed at the overlay for Floor 30’s Dungeon Block. It was marked in crimson. “And this? That’s not difficulty. That’s execution.”</p>
                        <p>Rann stood with her back to the wall, arms crossed, face blank. Her voice, when it came, was sharp enough to cut air.</p>
                        <p>“This isn’t a game anymore. It’s a hierarchy. Every floor is a screen. A stage. A punishment.”</p>
                        <p>Gerbert didn’t look away from the display. “And someone’s watching.”</p>
                        <p>Taan didn’t hesitate. “We’ll get to them.”</p>
                        <p>From the far corner, Ace lounged on a slanted bench, vines curled lazily around his fingers. His coat was draped over one shoulder, hair tousled, expression calm—but his eyes were sharp.</p>
                        <p>“Darlings,” he said, voice melodic, “they’ve built a tower for monsters. What they didn’t expect…” He sat up. “...was for the monsters to get smart.”</p>
                        <p>Rann raised an eyebrow. “You mean us?”</p>
                        <p>“Obviously,” Ace grinned. “We’re dangerous. We just need to stop acting like prey.”</p>
                        <p>Gerbert leaned back, his conjured notes collapsing into neat digital folders. “There’s more than one way to play this.”</p>
                        <p>Taan stood, unfolding like a spring. Her limbs moved with a subtle tension—restrained strength. “And we don’t have to play it their way.”</p>
                        <p>Ace stood next, stretching like a cat. “No, but if we’re going to climb their cursed tower, I’d like to make it look fabulous.”</p>
                        <p>No one laughed.</p>
                        <p>But no one argued.</p>
                        <p>They turned toward the hallway exit. The floor assignment had just pinged.</p>
                        <p>Gerbert closed the interface.</p>
                        <p>Rann cracked her neck.</p>
                        <p>Taan flexed her bandaged hands.</p>
                        <p>Ace sighed theatrically, stood, and spun his coat into place.</p>
                        <p>No one said a word.</p>
                        <p>But when the door opened—every step forward meant something.</p>
                        <p>The next floor awaited.</p>
                        <p>And this time, they understood the rules. Which meant they could break them.</p>
